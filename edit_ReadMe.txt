Most of the edits are either simple or explained in comments.

-ServletShowSemesterTable.java and showTable2.jsp are completley new files 


-ServletValidation.java has a section added to it that adds the semester in the previously inserted record,
that section should have comments and spaces clearly seperating it in the file

-ModelSearchResults.java has a new section that adds a few values into the table,these values are then used to make a "searchable"
table. That section should have a comment before it starts

-admin home has a section that basically adds a button that lets us use the searchable table w made together 

-web.xml was edited , I'm not really sure how but I remember it was


that should be all the changes I made let me know the instant you need anything.
