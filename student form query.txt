the following line should work as the query
after the word values the variables in () are what's added as the record into the database (I wrote the variables as if they were php but it's whatever you want)
alot of the values are either 0 or 1 depending on what the value the acutal variable(from the form itself) is when it's enetered so we'll need a bunch of if statements.
